MySQL/Node.js web-storefront CLI
 
 Added images, but not sure they'll show up so I'll put them in a file and push them.
 
 Basically, this is a command line interface web-storefront. You run it, it'll pull/show you all of the products available w/ their
corresponding IDs, you'll enter the ID number and quantity, and if you're successful, it'll say "Sale Complete!" otherwise it will
tell you that there is insufficient quantity and end connection.
 
Currently it doesn't show your total price since I was struggling with getting that set up, but I have the code commented out with the solution that I think will work, it just was giving me too many issues.
